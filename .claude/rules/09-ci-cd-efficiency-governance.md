# Rule 09 - CI/CD efficiency and release governance

## Contract

This repo is a single-package npm TypeScript CLI/library with repo-local Python/FastMCP maintainer tooling (`services/agent-mcp`) and a Blume docs site (`docs/`). There is no public Python service, Turborepo, repo workspace, `apps/`, or Vercel/Render deployment. CI may use alternate package managers only inside the isolated package-smoke lane. CI must stay high-signal and supply-chain-hardened: least-privilege tokens, immutable action pins, matrix coverage for every supported public runtime, and a release path that publishes via OIDC trusted publishing with build provenance. Runtime and library command behavior and the canonical script list live in `AGENTS.md`; this rule owns the CI/CD posture, not the package scripts.

## Workflow map

The complete public CI surface is the tracked workflows under `.github/workflows/`:

- `ci.yml`: the pull-request and `main`-push gate. Four jobs:
  - `quality` (matrix `node-version: [22, 24]`, no database): `npm ci`, `npm audit signatures`, `npm run build`, `npm run lint:ci` (the npm-owned Ultracite/Biome visible + active-local runner), `npm run format:md:check` (read-only Prettier), `npm run typecheck`, `npm run guard`, `npm run check:schema`, `npm run check:package`, then packs the tarball and smoke-tests `npx supaschema --version|diff|check`. On Node 22 only, CI prepares the alternate consumer package managers, runs `npm run package:smoke`, and runs the shipped `examples/` render+check plus `npm run test:examples`.
  - `check` (matrix `postgres: [15, 16, 17]` via a `postgres` service container): `npm run test:matrix`, coverage + Codecov upload through `npm run test:matrix:coverage` on `postgres == 17`, `npm run fixture:diff`, `npm run fixture:verify`, and `npm run corpus:check`: the replay-safety and reconvergence proofs that need a live database. `test:matrix*` excludes the examples lane owned by `quality`.
  - `check-os` (matrix `os: [macos-latest, windows-latest]`, no database): cross-platform path/git handling via `npm run test:matrix`; DB-gated test cases skip when no database is present, and example failures stay in `quality`.
  - `required` (`name: CI required`): one stable required-check context that succeeds only when every matrix-owning job succeeds.
- `release.yml`: triggered directly by protected `main`, with a main-only `workflow_dispatch` recovery path. A read-only preflight job decides whether npm, GitHub Packages, or GitHub Release work remains; only then can the `release` environment start the privileged publish job. It queues publishes with `concurrency.group: release-npm` + `queue: max`, runs on GitHub-hosted Ubuntu Node 24 with no database service, checks out `github.sha`, reruns preflight inside the privileged boundary, builds and package-checks only when publication is needed, packs and smokes the exact tarball, publishes with OIDC provenance, attests with `actions/attest@v4`, and creates or repairs the GitHub Release/tag from the top `CHANGELOG.md` entry. Already-complete versions stop after read-only preflight. Registry smoke remains an operator command, not a release workflow gate. A second privileged `publish-next` job owns snapshot publishing on every `main` push (never on `workflow_dispatch`), ordered after `publish` via `needs` + `always()`: it stamps an immutable `X.Y.(Z+1)-dev.<sha>` snapshot version (idempotent `npm view` probe skips republish), rebuilds so `dist/build-info.json` carries the snapshot version, packs and smokes the exact tarball, publishes to the `next` dist-tag with OIDC provenance, attests with `actions/attest@v4`, and registry-smokes the exact emitted version with npm/pnpm/Bun. It never touches `latest`, GitHub Releases, tags, or the GitHub Packages mirror, and it bypasses the stable-release preflight by design (snapshots carry no changelog entry). npm allows exactly one trusted publisher per package and supaschema's registration names `release.yml`, so every OIDC publish MUST run from a `release.yml` job; a separate publishing workflow's token is rejected with E404 after provenance signing.
- `consumer-canary.yml`: operator-dispatched (`workflow_dispatch` only) dogfooding lane. Clones a consumer repo (default `jmclaughlin724/anilize`) at a chosen ref, injecting `CONSUMER_CANARY_TOKEN` only for the exact `github.com` HTTPS host and removing it before consumer commands. It installs a chosen supaschema spec (exact snapshot version, resolved `next` tag, or local tarball) without committing manifest changes and runs the consumer's supaschema gates (`config validate`, `types --check`, `check`). Read-only token, no OIDC, no publish; it never gates releases.
- `dependency-review.yml`: pull-request supply-chain gate (`actions/dependency-review-action`): blocks high-severity vulnerable deps. License allow-listing was retired 2026-07-30 as metadata noise; the lane is vulnerability-only.
- `python.yml`: path-filtered (`services/**`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, the workflow itself) FastMCP service lane on pull requests and `main` push: `uv sync --locked` lock-freshness check, ruff lint and format check, mypy strict types, pytest, and a `pip-audit` vulnerability scan for `services/agent-mcp`.
- `scorecard.yml`: OpenSSF Scorecard on `main` push + weekly schedule, publishing results to the Scorecard API.
- `docs.yml`: path-filtered (`docs/**`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, the workflow itself) docs validation. It installs both roots (`npm ci`, then `npm ci --prefix docs` for the private Blume package), caching on both lockfiles, then runs `npm run docs:check`, which lints the docs standard and runs `blume doctor`, `blume validate`, and a full `blume build`.

## Hard rules

- Every workflow declares a top-level least-privilege `permissions:` block, defaulting to `contents: read` (or `read-all`). A job elevates only the exact scopes it needs: `release.yml`'s `publish` job adds `contents: write` for GitHub Release/tag creation plus `id-token: write` and `attestations: write` for trusted publishing/provenance; `scorecard.yml` adds `id-token: write`. Never grant write at the top level.
- All `uses:` refs are pinned to full-length commit SHAs with an adjacent version comment (for example `# v6.0.3`) for Dependabot readability. The executable ref must be immutable, never a tag or branch. This is the OpenSSF Scorecard "Pinned-Dependencies" check and a STOP condition if violated.
- `actions/checkout` uses `persist-credentials: false` on every tracked workflow's checkout (`ci.yml`, `consumer-canary.yml`, `dependency-review.yml`, `docs.yml`, `python.yml`, `release.yml`, `scorecard.yml`); release re-supplies an explicit `GH_TOKEN`/`registry-url` only where a step needs it.
- Every job declares a `timeout-minutes` ceiling so no lane can hang at the 360-minute default, least of all the privileged release job (`ci.yml` 20/30/20/5, `consumer-canary.yml` 30, `dependency-review.yml` 10, `docs.yml` 15, `python.yml` 15, release preflight/publish/publish-next 5/30/30, `scorecard.yml` 20).
- The privileged `release.yml` `publish` job runs `step-security/harden-runner` with `egress-policy: block` and the endpoint baseline verified from the 0.4.0 trusted-publishing run. Keep GitHub Actions OIDC/results endpoints, GitHub API/git, npm and GitHub Packages registries, and Sigstore Fulcio/Rekor/TUF endpoints explicit. The `publish-next` job runs the same baseline plus the GitHub release-asset CDN hosts (`objects.githubusercontent.com`, `release-assets.githubusercontent.com`) that the `setup-bun` download redirects to; without them the registry-smoke lane dies with ECONNREFUSED after the snapshot publish. Write `allowed-endpoints` as a folded YAML scalar (`>`) so Harden-Runner receives the space-separated endpoint tokens its agent requires; a literal scalar (`|`) preserves newlines and blocks every configured domain. Do not weaken the publish job back to audit-only egress.
- Releases publish through npm OIDC trusted publishing, not a stored npm token: the job runs on a GitHub-hosted runner with Node 24, asserts `npm >= 11.5.1`, sets `registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org`, disables package-manager caching on the privileged publish path, and runs `npm publish "$SUPASCHEMA_TARBALL" --access public --provenance`. npm trusted publishing already generates provenance; `--provenance` remains explicit repo policy. Tarball provenance is attested with `actions/attest@v4`. Do not reintroduce a long-lived `NPM_TOKEN`/`NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` secret.
- `main` is the npm and GitHub release source and is protected by mandatory PR plus current-main required checks. `release.yml` must not publish from GitHub Release events or `workflow_run`; it publishes after the protected merge push, with manual repair limited to `refs/heads/main`. The read-only preflight must gate entry into the write/OIDC job. Preflight fails closed when version surfaces disagree, a GitHub Release or tag already exists without its npm publish, or an existing tag points away from the release commit. Same-version reruns are idempotent.
- Runtime matrices match the support contract and must not silently narrow. `ci.yml` `quality` covers Node `[22, 24]` (the engines floor through the release major); `ci.yml` `check` covers PostgreSQL `[15, 16, 17]`; `check-os` covers macOS and Windows. Removing a supported Node major, Postgres major, or OS lane is a STOP condition.
- DB-independent gates and DB-dependent gates stay split. `quality` runs lint/typecheck/build/guard/package/pack-smoke with no `postgres` service and owns the single examples lane on Node 22. `check` owns the database-backed replay-safety proofs (`test:matrix`, `test:matrix:coverage`, `fixture:verify`, `corpus:check`) behind the `postgres` service matrix. Do not move database-backed steps into the no-DB lane or duplicate example tests across DB/OS matrix axes.
- Consumer package-manager smoke is allowed only inside `npm run package:smoke` and the matching Node 22 `quality` workflow steps. It may create throwaway consumer projects under temporary directories, but it must not introduce repo-root alternate lockfiles, workspaces, or maintainer install commands.
- Benchmarks are advisory, not CI or release gates. Keep `npm run benchmark` available for local or manual performance investigation, but do not run it from `ci.yml`, `release.yml`, or another required workflow path.
- The `check-os` matrix runs `npm run test:matrix` on Windows and macOS, so any test or script in that lane that spawns npm tooling must resolve the executable cross-platform: prefer `process.env.npm_execpath` executed through `process.execPath`, then fall back to `npm.cmd` on Windows and `npm` elsewhere when that env var is absent (the helper shape used by `scripts/guards/docs-config/check-schema.mjs`, `tests/package/contents.test.ts`, and `tests/config/install.test.ts`). Do not call a hard-coded bare `npm` with `shell: false`, which raises `ENOENT` on Windows. Bash-only constructs (`$(mktemp -d)`, `&&` chains, `out=$VAR`) belong only in `run:` steps and npm scripts the `check-os` lane does not invoke (it runs `npm ci`, `npm run build`, `npm run test:matrix`, `npm run fixture:diff`). Tests that spawn processes, hook entrypoints, or git fixtures must declare explicit vitest timeouts (the repo pattern is an options-object `{ timeout: 15_000 }`–`{ timeout: 20_000 }` or a named fixture-timeout constant): the 5s default flakes under parallel CI load, and on timeout vitest aborts mid-test so teardown races the still-running child and poisons following tests.
- Each `supaschema diff --out` render in a workflow writes to its own output subdirectory. supaschema treats the `--out` file's parent directory as the migrations dir for the lineage chain gate. Two renders sharing one directory (for example the `quality` lane's tarball smoke and examples smoke both writing into `$RUNNER_TEMP`) make the first render look like a pending migration the second must continue, a false `SUPA_DIFF_LINEAGE_BROKEN`. Give each render an isolated `--out` directory; supaschema auto-creates the parent.
- Concurrency is declared in each PR-facing workflow (`ci.yml`, `dependency-review.yml`, `docs.yml`) as `group: "${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}"` with `cancel-in-progress: true`, so superseded PR runs are cancelled. `release.yml` queues every release transaction and never cancels an in-flight publish.
- Path-filtered workflows (`docs.yml`, `python.yml`) gate on their owned trees plus their own workflow file and the lockfile inputs that affect them. These are independent advisory workflows, not required checks short-circuited by `paths-ignore`; do not convert a required gate (`ci.yml`) into a path-skipped check.
- CI/docs Node lanes use `actions/setup-node` with npm caching where appropriate; the privileged release job disables package-manager caching to avoid unnecessary package-manager side effects on the OIDC publish path. There is no external or remote build cache in this repo.
- Supply-chain verification is layered and must stay wired: `npm audit signatures` (registry signature check) in `quality` and `release`, `actions/dependency-review-action` on PRs, and OpenSSF Scorecard. Do not remove a public check to make a run green.
- Commit signoff enforcement MUST NOT be wired into CI quality jobs.
- Dependency Review remains read-only and vulnerability-only: report through the check summary, do not re-enable license allow/deny lists, and do not enable PR comments that require `pull-requests: write`. Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`) keeps weekly updates across `npm` and `github-actions` so SHA pins stay current.
- Repository Actions policy allows GitHub-owned actions plus the exact reviewed third-party action repositories used by the tracked workflows; full-SHA pinning remains mandatory. Do not restore `allowed_actions: all`.
- GitHub Actions and OIDC concepts that do not exist here must not be invented into the rule: there is no `turbo.json`, no `--affected` graph, no remote-cache token wiring, no scope-detection script, no `ci_monitor`, and no Render/Vercel deploy workflow. CI is the plain workflow set above.

## Enforced by

- `npm run guard` (`scripts/guards/check-all.mjs`) — repository invariants (tooling stack, canonical surfaces, agent surfaces, dependency catalog, and LSP coverage), run inside `ci.yml`'s `quality` job. Public guard scans over agents, skills, rules, and policy files MUST derive their file lists from `git ls-files --cached`, not raw filesystem directory walks, so ignored local DX cannot satisfy or break CI-only requirements. It MUST run a second targeted public-checkout pass for local-only maintainer surfaces with `SUPASCHEMA_PUBLIC_CHECKOUT=1` and emit `PUBLIC_CHECKOUT_GUARDS_OK`, so ignored local files cannot mask clean GitHub checkout failures.
- `npm run guard:ci` (`scripts/guards/ci-release/check-ci-governance.mjs`, part of `npm run guard`) — parses every tracked workflow with the `yaml` dependency and asserts this rule's STOP invariants deterministically: top-level least privilege, SHA pins, credential handling, PR concurrency, the stable `CI required` aggregation job, read-only vulnerability-only Dependency Review with no license allow/deny lists and no PR-comment writes, release queueing, read-only release preflight, conditional write/OIDC entry, block-mode egress endpoints, trusted publishing, exact tarball smoke/publish, provenance attestation, changelog-owned GitHub Release creation, supported runtime matrices, single-owner examples, and `python.yml` staying tracked with the agent MCP service.
- `npm run lint:ci` (the package-owned Ultracite/Biome runner with GitHub diagnostics), `npm run format:md:check` (read-only Prettier), `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npm run check:schema`, `npm run check:package`, and `npm run package:smoke`: the static and packaging gates the `quality` matrix runs.
- `npm run test:matrix`, `npm run test:matrix:coverage`, `npm run fixture:verify`, and `npm run corpus:check`: the database-backed replay-safety proofs the `check` matrix runs.
- The seven workflow files themselves under `.github/workflows/` (`ci.yml`, `consumer-canary.yml`, `dependency-review.yml`, `docs.yml`, `python.yml`, `release.yml`, `scorecard.yml`), plus `.github/dependabot.yml`.
- `lefthook.yml` for local pre-commit hooks that mirror the lint/format gates before code reaches CI.

STOP if a tracked workflow does any of these:

- Grants top-level write permissions, unpins an action, restores unrestricted action admission, or drops `persist-credentials: false`.
- Permits direct `main` updates without the stable CI and dependency checks, or lets a no-op release enter the write/OIDC job.
- Weakens Harden-Runner from block mode, replaces OIDC with a stored npm token, drops release provenance or version gates, or publishes from an unprotected source.
- Removes a supported runtime matrix, drops a required check, or removes stale-run cancellation from a PR workflow.
- Shares one migration output directory across independent renders.

STOP if anyone reintroduces Turborepo, remote-cache, `--affected`, maintainer pnpm/Yarn/Bun install workflows, or Vercel/Render deploy machinery into the CI surface or into this rule. The isolated package-smoke lane is the only CI exception for alternate package managers.

## Verification

After workflow, release, supply-chain, matrix, package, or CI guard changes, run:

```bash
npm run guard:ci
npm run guard
```

For package-release changes, also run `npm run release:verify`.

## Failure behavior

Fix the workflow or guard. Do not remove scanners, narrow required matrices, unpin actions, introduce stored npm tokens, weaken OIDC/provenance, or move database proofs into release to make CI faster.

## Done means

Workflow permissions are least-privilege, actions are full-SHA pinned, release remains main/OIDC/provenance based, matrices match support, and CI guards prove the posture.
