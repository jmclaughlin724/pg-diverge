# Rule 19 - Version control and release

## Contract

This rule owns the operator workflow for version bumps, release notes, the mandatory `$update` audit, and release-control git work. When a user says to update supaschema to a version, that is one release-version transaction: update every version-coupled surface, run `$update` after versioning, prove parity with the guards, then stage, commit, push, or open the PR when requested. Do not ask the user to enumerate these steps.

## Publishing is automatic when a version bump merges

`.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers on `push` to `main`, and its preflight decides whether the pushed version still needs publishing. Merging a PR that bumps `package.json` `version` therefore publishes to npm and creates the GitHub Release with no separate publish step and no publish approval to request afterward. Merging a PR that leaves the version unchanged releases nothing: preflight finds the version already published and exits successfully.

- Approval to merge a version-bumped PR is approval to release. Do not merge and then report publishing as still blocked or still pending.
- Never run `npm publish`, `npm version` with a tag push, or `gh release create` locally. Releases publish through npm OIDC trusted publishing with build provenance from the privileged workflow job; a local publish bypasses provenance attestation and is prohibited even when npm credentials are present.
- Before telling a user that a release step remains, read `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers and resolve the release run for the merge commit. Registry state, the GitHub Release, and that run's conclusion are the evidence; an external handoff, plan, or issue claiming a manual publish step is not.
- When a merge is requested and the branch carries a version bump, say that merging publishes before merging, then merge and verify with the post-merge commands below.
- Tie release proof to the merge SHA and to a terminal conclusion. `gh run list --workflow=release.yml` alone lists recent runs and can match an older success, so it never proves the current release; use `--commit <merge-sha>` and wait for the run to finish. A published npm version does not prove the GitHub Release step succeeded, so check both.
- `workflow_dispatch` on `main` is the recovery path when a push-triggered run fails or a version needs GitHub Release repair. Preflight is idempotent: an already-published version exits successfully without republishing.

## Release-note owner

`CHANGELOG.md` is the canonical release-note owner for npm and GitHub releases. The top entry for `package.json` `version` must be `## <version> (YYYY-MM-DD)` and must contain non-empty, user-readable notes. `scripts/release/changelog-notes.mjs` extracts that entry for GitHub Release creation; do not use GitHub auto-generated release notes as the published release body.

Changesets may collect PR-local release intent and may drive `npm run release:version`, but after versioning the generated top `CHANGELOG.md` entry is the source of truth. If `CHANGELOG.md`, GitHub Release notes, npm version, package metadata, or `action.yml` disagree, fix the canonical release transaction before publishing or repairing a release.

## Version bump transaction

When asked to create or update to version `<version>`, do all of this in the same change:

1. Inspect `git status --short --branch`.
2. Update `package.json` and `package-lock.json` together. Prefer `npm version <version> --no-git-tag-version` unless both files already carry the requested version.
3. Add or update the top `CHANGELOG.md` entry as `## <version> (YYYY-MM-DD)` with concise, source-grounded release notes.
4. Keep `action.yml` `inputs.version.default` unset; the action runner defaults from `package.json`. Keep exact-version validation text generic and do not duplicate `<version>` in the runner message.
5. Search for other version-coupled release surfaces introduced by the change and update them in the same commit.
6. Run `$update` as the final impact audit after all release-owned changes are present. Resolve every in-scope finding and run the owner, sync, docs, package, consumer, and generated-surface validation selected by the skill before continuing.
7. Run `npm run release:notes -- --version <version>` to inspect the release body that GitHub will publish.
8. Run `npm run guard:release-version` before broader release or package checks.

A version bump that only changes `package.json` and `package-lock.json` is incomplete.

## Git and PR transaction

When the user asks to stage, commit, push, or create a PR after a version bump, use these release specifics:

- Use a release-specific commit message such as `Prepare release <version>` or `Enforce release version surfaces`.
- Push only the intended release branch.
- When asked for a PR, create a non-draft PR unless the user explicitly says draft. Include the version, changelog, release-surface parity, base branch, head branch, commit count, changed-file count, mergeability result, and verification commands in the PR body.
- If CI fails on a version-coupled surface, fix the source drift and add or update guard coverage so the same miss fails locally next time.

## Enforced by

- `npm run guard:release-version` (`scripts/guards/ci-release/check-release-version-surfaces.mjs`) asserts that:
  - `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and the lockfile root package version agree;
  - the first `CHANGELOG.md` version heading matches the package version, uses an ISO date, and contains release notes;
  - `action.yml` leaves `inputs.version.default` unset so the runner defaults from `package.json`;
  - the action validation message tells users to use an exact npm version without copying the current version.
- `scripts/release/preflight.mjs` repeats the package, lockfile, and changelog release-note checks before the release workflow decides whether to publish npm or repair GitHub Release state.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` creates GitHub Releases with `--notes-file` from `scripts/release/changelog-notes.mjs`, not `--generate-notes`.
- `npm run guard` runs `guard:release-version` through `scripts/guards/check-all.mjs`.
- `tests/release/action.test.ts` verifies the composite action default follows `package.json` and does not drift to npm dist-tags.
- Snapshot publishing is the one permitted dist-tag write: `snapshot.yml` publishes immutable `X.Y.(Z+1)-dev.<sha>` builds to the `next` tag from protected `main` pushes. The `latest` tag remains release.yml-only, and consuming a snapshot always resolves to an exact version before install; dist-tags remain forbidden for action execution.
- The release checklist and release PR checklist require `$update` after versioning and before release verification or merge. The audit is semantic and is reviewed through its changed owners and validation evidence; do not add a forgeable marker file or brittle prose guard to simulate execution proof.

STOP if a version bump does any of these:

- Leaves any known release surface on the previous version, or skips `$update` after the final release-owned changes.
- Adds a GitHub Action default version, or uses an npm dist-tag for action execution.
- Omits the changelog top entry, or publishes a GitHub Release body from auto-generated notes instead of `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Commits generated mirrors without syncing from the canonical owner, bypasses hooks, or weakens a guard or test to make the release pass.

## Verification

For every version bump, run:

```bash
npm run guard:release-version
npm run release:notes -- --version <version>
npm test -- tests/release/action.test.ts
```

For package or release workflow changes, also run:

```bash
npm run release:verify
npm run check:package
npm run pack:dry
npm run guard
```

For rule or generated agent-surface changes, also run:

```bash
npm run sync:llm
```

After merging a version-bumped PR into `main`, prove the automatic release instead of reporting a pending publish. Resolve the run for the merge commit, wait for it, and check its conclusion:

```bash
gh run list --workflow=release.yml --commit <merge-sha> --json databaseId,status,conclusion
gh run watch <run-id> --exit-status
npm view supaschema version
gh release view v<version> --json tagName,publishedAt,isDraft
```

## Failure behavior

Fix the drift in the canonical source. Do not add an action version default, loosen the exact-version validation, skip the changelog, or bypass hooks.

## Done means

All version-coupled surfaces agree with the package version, `$update` has closed every confirmed impact after the final release-owned changes, the changelog top entry names that version and is the GitHub Release body source, local release-version guards pass, and requested git and PR actions completed without touching unrelated work.

When the transaction included a merge to `main`, the release is also verified rather than assumed: the `release.yml` run for the merge commit succeeded, `npm view supaschema version` reports the released version, and the GitHub Release exists for its tag. No publish step is reported as outstanding.
